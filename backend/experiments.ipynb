      "\n",
      "1. **Visibility of System Status (NS01):** 4/5\n",
      "\n",
      "   The system status is well conveyed by displaying available courses clearly with images, titles, and descriptions. However, there is no loading indicator for cases when the list is being fetched which could enhance status visibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **User Control and Freedom (NS02):** 3/5\n",

      "   Users can view courses through clearly marked buttons, but there is no visible option to filter or sort courses, which could provide better control and freedom in navigation.\n",

      "   The message \"There are no courses yet!\" is clear if no courses are available. However, there could be more guidance on refreshing or checking again later to improve error recovery.\n",

      "4. **Consistency and Standards (NS04):** 4/5\n",
      "\n",
      "   The design is consistent in terms of layout and button styling. However, the use of different column classes (cols-sm-6, col-md-4, col-lg-3) for the card layout seems inconsistent without clear differentiation in usage.\n",

      "5. **Recognition Rather than Recall (NS05):** 4/5\n",
      "\n",
      "   Course information is presented clearly, minimizing the need for users to recall details from memory. Enhancement could be made by providing a search bar.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Match Between System and the Real World (NS06):** 5/5\n",
      "\n",
      "   The interface uses familiar icons and terminology (e.g., courses, view buttons) which aligns well with real-world contexts.\n",

      "7. **Error Prevention (NS07):** 3/5\n",
      "\n",
      "   The design does not include mechanisms to prevent errors, such as a confirmation step before visiting a course. Adding such features could improve this aspect.\n",

      "8. **Flexibility and Efficiency of Use (NS08):** 3/5\n",

      "   Basic efficiency is provided, but there is no apparent use of shortcuts or customization options that could facilitate more effective use by frequent users.\n",

      "9. **Aesthetic and Minimalist Design (NS09):** 4/5\n",
