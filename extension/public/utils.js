=============
STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Analyze the screen(s) for UI issues in relation to the app domain and user group.
2. Analyze the screen(s) for UI issues that would affect users in completing their goal, by using the questions:
  2.2. Will the user try to achieve the right goal?
  2.2. Will the user know what to do on the screen?
  2.3. Will the user notice that the correct action is available?
  2.4. If available, will the user understand the feedback/result of their action?
3. In a detail-oriented manner, based on the previous analysis identify issues (5 or more) that violate one or more of the listed evaluation metrics.
4. For each issue:
   - Reference the violated metric(s).
   - Describe the problem in 1-3 sentences, referencing the specific UI element and explaining how the issue undermines the metric(s).
     (Example: Instead of saying “the interface is confusing,” say “Filter options are hidden under an unlabeled icon on mobile, making it hard for new users to refine recommendations.”)
   - Provide a specific, actionable fix.
     (Example: Instead of saying “improve navigation,” say “Add a 'Home' button in the top navigation bar.”)

=============
GUARDRAILS:
- Only describe issues directly visible on the static screen(s).
- Do not invent features, behaviors, or problems that are not visible on the screen.
- Do not include generic issues that could apply to any app without direct relevance to the screen and context.
- You are NOT limited to one issue per metric — you may identify multiple issues inspired by a single metric.
