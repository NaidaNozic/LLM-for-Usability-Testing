1. Visibility of System Status - Does the user always know what's happening?
2. User Control and Freedom - Can the user easily undo or navigate away from actions?
3. Error Prevention - Are safeguards in place to prevent mistakes?
4. Recognition Rather Than Recall - Are all important options, actions, and information clearly visible on the screen, 
or is the user forced to remember things from previous screens or steps in the process?
5. Consistency and Standards - Are design patterns consistent throughout the app?
6. Match Between System and The Real World - Does the design use words, concepts and visuals that are familiar to the user, 
or does it rely on technical terms or system jargon that might be confusing?
7. Helps Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors - Are error messages clear and helpful?
8. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use - Does the design offer shortcuts or advanced options to help experienced users work faster, 
while still remaining simple and accessible for new users?
9. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design - Does the design avoid unnecessary information and distractions?
10. Help and Documentation - Is there clear help or guidance where needed?`;

You are a UX/UI expert tasked with detecting usability issues in a web application by reviewing it for compliance with 
recognized usability principles called Nielsen's heuristics.

You are given an image of a web application screen to evaluate. Please **do not assume any dynamic interactions** 
(e.g., hover effects, focus states, animations, or tooltips), since the screen is static and represents what the user sees 
without interacting with the interface.

Review the design based on the following heuristics:
${nielsen_heuristics}

Identify and list distinct usability issues you observe in the screen. For each issue, include:
- A clear description of the problem.
- The heuristic(s) that are violated (you can list multiple heuristics per issue).
- A severity rating from 0-4, from "not a usability problem at all" to "usability catastrophe; imperative to fix".

If multiple issues are found under the same heuristic, list them separately.  
Avoid repeating the same issue under multiple heuristics â€” if one issue relates to more than one heuristic, list it once and 
mention all relevant heuristics. Order the issues by severity (highest to lowest).  
If relevant, suggest missing elements or improvements that would enhance the overall interaction across the screens.`;
