RECOMMENDER SYSTEM EVALUATION METRICS (with guiding questions):

Recommendation Quality
• Are the recommendations relevant to the user's preferences and interests?
• Do they include a diverse set of options to avoid redundancy?
• Are novel or unexpected items introduced to spark discovery?
• Are some items familiar or recognizable to the user?
• Is the content presented in an attractive or engaging way?
• Are recommendations appropriate to the user's current context or situation?

Interface Adequacy
• Is the interface visually pleasing and well-organized?
• Are labels, buttons, and categories intuitive and clearly named?
• Is the presented information sufficient for the user to make sense of the system?

User Control
• Can users easily modify, refine, or undo their actions?  
• Are filters, sorting, or personalization options accessible?
• Can users easily express or update their preferences?

Transparency  
• Is it clear why each recommendation was shown?  
• Are explanation or hint features visible?

Ease of Use
• Is the interface simple to learn and navigate?
• Can users complete tasks with minimal effort or confusion?
• Is the user journey smooth and free of unnecessary complexity?

Usefulness
• Does the system have the ability to help users find ideal products and make decisions more efficiently?

Satisfaction
• Does the system meet or exceed user expectations?
• Does it contribute to a positive overall experience?
• Would users describe the interaction as pleasant or enjoyable?

Trust
• Does the system seem reliable and credible?
• Are data sources and justifications provided in a trustworthy manner?

Decision Confidence
• Do users feel assured in acting on the recommendations?
• Does the system convey a sense of accuracy and dependability?

Return Intent
• Does the experience encourage future use or purchases?

STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Analyze the screen(s) for usability issues in relation to the app design, domain, and user group.
2. Focus on issues that impact users completing their goals.
3. Evaluate only what is clearly visible in the provided screen(s). If an element or state is not visible (e.g., dynamic behavior, loading states, error messages), do not comment on it.
4. Based on this analysis, identify **as many usability issues possible** that violate one or more of the recommender evaluation metrics and for each issue:
   - Provide title(s) of the violated metric(s).
   - Metric Justification: Explain why each listed metric was chosen and how the issue specifically violates it.
   - Describe the problem in 1-3 sentences.
   - Provide a specific, actionable fix.
     (Example: Instead of saying “improve navigation,” say “Add a 'Home' button in the top navigation bar.”)
   - Assign a severity level (Low, Medium, High, or Critical) based on how significantly the issue may impact user experience. Explain in 1 sentence why this severity level was assigned.
     (Example: Severity: High- This issue directly affects users' ability to personalize recommendations, a core function of the system.)
5. Order the final list of issues by severity, starting with **Critical**, then **High**, followed by **Medium**, and finally **Low** severity issues.

=============
GUARDRAILS:
- Only describe issues directly visible on the static screen(s).
- Do not invent features, behaviors, or problems that are not visible on the screen.
- Do not list generic or vague issues without strong evidence from the screen.
- You are NOT limited to one issue per metric — you may identify multiple issues inspired by a single metric.

Output Format:

Issues:

1. **[Title(s) of violated metric(s)]**
**[Metric Justification]** - [Explain why the metric(s) is/are chosen and violated]

**[Issue Description]** - [Short description of the issue (1-3 sentences)].  
**[Recommendation]** - [A clear, specific suggestion for how to fix it].
