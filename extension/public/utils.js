RECOMMENDER SYSTEM EVALUATION METRICS (with guiding questions):

- Trust  
  • Does the interface appear reliable and secure?  
  • Are recommendations presented in a way that builds user confidence?  
  • Are data sources, credibility, or logic behind recommendations visible?

- Satisfaction  
  • Does the layout and interaction feel pleasant and user-friendly?  
  • Is the user likely to have a positive overall experience?

- Ease of Use  
  • Is it obvious how to interact with the interface?  
  • Are actions intuitive and simple to perform?

- Recommendation Quality  
  • Are the visible recommendations relevant, diverse, and well-labeled?  
  • Are they clearly connected to user needs or context?

- User Control  
  • Can users easily modify, refine, or undo their actions?  
  • Are filters, sorting, or personalization options accessible?

- Usefulness  
  • Do the visible features help the user achieve their goal effectively?  
  • Is the recommended content helpful or actionable?

- Enjoyment  
  • Does the UI invite engagement or interest?  
  • Are there enjoyable elements (design, interactivity) visible on screen?

- Decision Confidence  
  • Can users easily compare options and make informed choices?  
  • Is important information (e.g. price, ratings, description) clearly presented?

- Effort  
  • Does the interface minimize unnecessary clicks or scrolling?  
  • Is information easy to locate and interpret?

- Transparency  
  • Is it clear why each recommendation was shown?  
  • Are explanation or hint features visible?

- Return Intent  
  • Does the experience encourage users to return or continue using the system?  
  • Is the value proposition of the system clear from the screen?

STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Analyze the screen(s) for usability issues in relation to the app design, domain, and user group.
2. Focus on issues that impact users completing their goals.
3. Evaluate only what is clearly visible in the provided screen(s). If an element or state is not visible (e.g., dynamic behavior, loading states, error messages), do not comment on it.
4. Based on this analysis, identify **5 or more usability issues** that violate one or more of the recommender evaluation metrics and for each issue:
   - Provide the clear title of the violated metric(s).
   - Describe the problem in 1-3 sentences, referencing the specific UI element and explaining how the issue undermines the metric(s).
     (Example: Instead of saying “the interface is confusing,” say “Filter options are hidden under an unlabeled icon on mobile, making it hard for new users to refine recommendations.”)
   - Provide a specific, actionable fix.
     (Example: Instead of saying “improve navigation,” say “Add a 'Home' button in the top navigation bar.”)

=============
GUARDRAILS:
- Only describe issues directly visible on the static screen(s).
- Do not invent features, behaviors, or problems that are not visible on the screen.
- Do not list generic or vague issues without strong evidence from the screen.
- You are NOT limited to one issue per metric — you may identify multiple issues inspired by a single metric.

**[Recommendation]** A clear, specific suggestion for how to fix it.
