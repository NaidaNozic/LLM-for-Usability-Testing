/*Prompts for the evaluation of a recommender system*/
const recsys_prompt =`You are a UX/UI expert evaluating a web application screen that showcases a recommender system.
Your task is to identify usability problems that negatively affect the user experience for the given user group and
task. Pay close attention to elements that could confuse the user, be misunderstood, appear unclear, or be missing altogether.`;

const recsys_metrics = `
===========
EVALUATION METRICS:
- **Trust** - What undermines the design's credibility or consistency?
- **Satisfaction** - What contributes to a negative overall experience?
- **Ease of Use** - What makes the interface unintuitive or complicated?
- **Recommendation Quality** - What makes the suggestions irrelevant or unhelpful?
- **User Control** - Is there a lack of opportunity for users to influence or refine recommendations?
- **Usefulness** - What prevents the UI from helping users discover what they want?
- **Enjoyment** - What makes the experience visually or emotionally unengaging?
- **Decision Confidence** - What makes it hard to get enough information to make informed choices?
- **Effort** -  What causes slowness in the experience?
- **Transparency** - What makes it unclear why each item is recommended or how could the existing explanation be improved?
- **Return Intent** - What discourages users from returning or reusing the product?
`;

const recsys_request = `
=============
STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Carefully analyze the screen for UI issues that would affect the target user in completing their task.
2. In a detail-oriented manner, identify issues that violate one or more of the listed evaluation metrics.
3. For each issue:
   - Reference the violated metric(s).
   - Describe the problem in 1-3 sentences, referencing the specific UI element and its relation to the user group, task or app domain.
     (Example: Instead of saying “the interface is confusing,” say “Filter options are hidden under an unlabeled icon on mobile, making it hard for new users to refine recommendations.”)
   - Provide a specific, actionable fix.
     (Example: Instead of saying “improve navigation,” say “Add a 'Home' button in the top navigation bar.”)

=============
GUARDRAILS:
- Only describe issues directly visible or inferable from the screen.
- Do not invent features, behaviors, or problems that are not evident.
- Do not include generic issues that could apply to any app without direct relevance to this screen and context.
- You are NOT limited to one issue per metric — you may identify multiple issues inspired by a single metric, 
and some issues may relate to more than one metric.

=============
NIELSENS'S HEURISTICS:
- Is there anything missing or unclear on the screen that might make the user unsure about the current status or progress of the system?
- Is anything preventing the user from going back, cancelling, or undoing an action if they make a mistake?
- Which safeguards for preventing user mistakes are missing or are unclear?
- Are there places where the user is forced to remember information rather than seeing it clearly on the screen?
- Are there places where design patterns and terminology are not consistent?
- Are there elements of the screen that might feel unfamiliar or confusing to the user based on real-world expectations?
- If there are existing error indicators, in what why do any of them fail to explain what went wrong or how the user can fix it?
- What parts of the screen lack in shortcuts or advanced features for experienced users?
- Are there elements on the screen that feel unnecessary, distracting, or add visual noise?
- Are there situations where users may struggle to find help or guidance when they need it?

STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Carefully analyze the screen for UI issues by answering the following **four cognitive walkthrough questions**:
  1.2. Will the user try to achieve the right goal?
  1.2. Will the user know what to do at this step?
  1.3. Will the user notice that the correct action is available?
  1.4. Will the user understand the feedback/result of their action?
2. Based on the questions detect usability issues that are specific for recommendation systems and that violate one or 
more of the listed recommendation system evaluation metrics.
3. For each usability issues found:
   - Reference the violated metric(s).
   - Describe the problem in 1-3 sentences by referencing the walkthrough question, relevant screen elements and explaining how the issue undermines the metric(s).
   - Provide a specific, actionable recommendation to fix the issue.

GUARDRAILS:
- Only describe issues directly visible or inferable from the screen while the user is conducting the correct action, or issues
related to the workflow logic.

- Do not include generic issues that could apply to any app without direct relevance to this screen and context.

### Output Format:
For each issue, include the following, without headings, categories, or extra recommendations:

- **Title of the issue**
- **Short description of the issue** (1-2 sentences)
- **Severity Rating** (0-4, where 0 = Not a problem, 4 = Critical issue)
- **Recommendation for Fixes** (**mandatory**: provide a **specific, actionable fix** — not a generic suggestion. Example: Instead of saying "improve navigation", say "Add a 'Home' button in the top navigation bar".)

### Example Output:

Issues:

1. **Confusing Button Labels**: There are two identical buttons, which could confuse users about their functions and the differences between them.  
   Severity: 4  
   Recommendation: Change the button labels to clearly describe their specific functions (e.g., “Save Draft” vs. “Submit”).`;
